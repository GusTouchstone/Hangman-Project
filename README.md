# Hangman-Project
This project aims to create a word game to guess a word before the player runs out of attempts. The game should be challenging and rewarding for players of all skill levels and ages. 

Hangman Game
Welcome to the Hangman Game! This is a simple text-based game where the player tries to guess a word letter by letter within a certain number of attempts.

How to Play
The game will display a series of underscores representing the letters in the secret word.
The player will guess one letter at a time.
If the guessed letter is in the secret word, it will be revealed in the correct position(s) in the word.
If the guessed letter is not in the secret word, the player will lose one attempt.
The game continues until the player guesses all the letters in the secret word or runs out of attempts.
